# Pomo  

  Command-line application for the [Pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) time management technique.
  
## Description

With Pomo you can add, remove, list, view, and start timing tasks all via the 
command-line with a simple, slick interface. You are reminded of the remaining 
time on a task via Growl. These notifications appear half-way, at the 5 minute point, 
and when the task duration has expired. 
  
## Examples

View global or command specific help:
    $ pomo help
    $ pomo help add
    $ pomo help remove

Get started by adding a task:
    $ pomo add "Fix IE stying issues"
    
And another:
    $ pomo add "Destroy IE" --description "because IE is terrible"
    
List your tasks:
    $ pomo list
        0. Fix IE stying issues                : 25 minutes
        1. Destroy IE                          : 25 minutes

Start the first task:
    $ pomo start
    Started Fix IE stying issues, you have 25 minutes :)
    (=........................) 24 minutes remaining
    
Once you have completed the task, list again:
    $ pomo list
      âˆš 0. Fix IE stying issues                : 25 minutes
        1. Destroy IE                          : 25 minutes
        
At any time mid-task you may terminate pomo via CTRL + C, at which time
you may manually complete the task:
    $ pomo complete first
    $ pomo complete last
    $ pomo complete 1
    $ pomo complete 5
        
The next time you run `pomo start` the first incomplete task will start:
    $ pomo start
    
Or choose a specific task:
    $ pomo start first
    $ pomo start last
    $ pomo start 5
    
You may also remove tasks
    $ pomo remove first
    $ pomo remove last
    $ pomo remove 2
    $ pomo remove 1
    $ pomo remove 6
    $ pomo rm first
    $ pomo rm last
    
View task details:
    $ pomo view first
    $ pomo view last
    $ pomo view 5
    $ pomo view 1
